# Copy Blender Info

Finding Blender's application info for filling a bug report can be "tedious". A user needs to view Blender's splash screen and either needs to memorize the hashcode and date and time or some how do split window magic.

My take on simplifying this is to simply copy data to the clipboard so the user only needs to paste the data. Done!
